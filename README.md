### Hey, I'm Julen ðŸ‘‹

I am a robotics and machine learning researcher, developing generalizable skills for robots to deploy in household robotics. 

- ðŸŽ“ I am a Research Scientist @ FAIR. I am working in the Embodiment & Actions team working on Dexterous Manipulation.
- ðŸ¤– I am interested in learning generalizable robotics manipulation skills by combining Deep Generative Models, Motion Planning and Control, Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning.
