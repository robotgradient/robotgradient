### Hey, I'm Julen ðŸ‘‹

I am a robotics and machine learning researcher, developing generalizable skills for robots to deploy in household robotics. 

- ðŸŽ“ I am a PhD student at TU Darmstadt, advised by [Jan Peters](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/Member/JanPeters).
- ðŸ¤– My research explores ways to integrate Physics and Geometrical inductive biases to learn generalizable robotics manipulation.
- ðŸ’» I am currently a research intern in NVIDIA's Robotics Research Lab lead by [Dieter Fox](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~fox/).

If it sounds like we might get along, [hit me up](mailto:julen@robot-learning.de).
